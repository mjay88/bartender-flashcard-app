# Cocktail Flash Card App

Sticking with the bar theme, this is another idea that first occurred to me when I was managing at the bar I still work at. This is an app I made to help bartenders memorize cocktail recipes.

Built with expo SDK, all of the styling is custom. I’m using Firebase for authentication with a basic email password flow with react-native-async-storage to store authorization tokens for automatic login, and I’m using expo-sql-lite for storing data locally, which is just the users favorites deck (A user can favorite a card and it is saved locally).

Once a user is logged in or registered, they can select a deck by category and scroll through the cards to familiarize themselves with the recipes. When they are ready they can shuffle the deck and challenge themselves to memorize each recipe by flipping the card over.

The card flip animation is done with the help of the [react-native-reanimated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-reanimated) library

# Usage

To run app in development mode enter the command npx expo start in the terminal from the root project folder, and either: scan the qr-code generated by Expo SDK for running development mode on iphone (you must have the Expo Go app installed on your phone), or press a to open on Android (you must have a Virtual Device running generated by Android Studio), or follow the any of the other options generate from the Expo SDK
